This is my first post :D finally, after a couple of hours invested on learning the tools and setting them up, I can write something.

I want to use this space to spread the word about the stuff I like, my personal projects, and the stuff I learn on my everyday
 life as a Software Engineer, on a fresh manner, and with ❤️.

The lesson I learned today is: on the "front matter" section of each post, the date controls when the post shows up on the feed.

To build up this blog I used Centrarium, a custom theme for [Jekyll][jekyll], made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog.
Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).
Make sure to check it up!
